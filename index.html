				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Tyler dreamed of flying high in the media world – even as a kid. He was just 10 when he started his first venture: a monthly Christian bulletin called Tyler’s Bible Newsletter. He wrote, designed and distributed the periodical, which featured inspirational articles. And he’s been working toward his goals ever since.</p>
				<p>A native of North Port, Florida, Tyler began interning for the local newspaper when he was 12. Just a few years later, he was freelancing. His passion for communications has grown from those early experiences.</p>
